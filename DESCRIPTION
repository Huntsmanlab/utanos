Description: A set of functions that assist in the analysis of shallow/low-pass 
    whole genome sequencing (WGS) and subsequent visualization. It includes 
    built-in options for plotting, quality evaluation, data re-structuring, 
    copy-number aberration exploration, copy-number signature inference, 
    and HRD identification.
