This vignette serves to demonstrate how to use copy-number (CN) abnormalities, which could represent the imprints of distinct mutational processes, and create signatures from these CN-features.
In order to generate new copy-number signatures, a set of samples are needed for which you have segmented copy-number profiles.
These profiles should be formatted as a list of named dataframes. One for each sample.

### I - The input data...

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
library(utanos)
library(QDNAseq)
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)

# Reading in test data
segmented_aCNs <- readRDS("~/projects/cn-signatures-project/segmented_aCNs.rds")
# QDNAseq object
dplyr::glimpse(head(segmented_aCNs, 3))

### II - Do some modelling...

To begin...  
1. First, extract CN-features using the ExtractCopynumberFeatures() function.  
2. Fit mixture components.  
3. Calculate a patient-by-component sum-of-posterior probabilities matrix.  
4. Search for the optimal number of signatures (interval of 3-12 is used by default), running NMF 1000 times with different random seeds for each signature number.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
CN_features <- ExtractCopynumberFeatures(copy_numbers_input)
component_models <- FitMixtureModels(CN_features)
sample_by_component <- GenerateSampleByComponentMatrix(CN_features, component_models)
ChooseNumberSignatures(sample_by_component)

```


#3 Expanded: For each copy-number event in each sample, compute the posterior probability of belonging to a component. For each sample, sum these posterior event vectors to a sum-of-posterior probabilities vector. Combine sum-of-posterior vectors into a patient-by-component sum-of-posterior probabilities matrix.  
  
  
The output from the ChooseNumberSignatures() function is a figure plotting several metrics that aid in the selection of an optimal number of signatures.
These metrics include cophenetic, dispersion, silhouette, and sparseness.  
  
What to look for in the values of each metric:  
cophenetic: after the trend begins increasing (after 2) choose the max value before it decreases again.  
dispersion: higher == better, measures the reproducibility  
silhouette: higher == better, measures consistency between clusters  
sparseness: higher == better, try to choose the maximum sparsity which can be achieved without exceeding that which was observed in the randomly permuted matrices  
  
Here is an example of said figure.  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/choose_optimal_Nsignatures_metrics.png", dpi = 200)
```
  
  
### III - Stop and evaluate

At this point it is a good idea to stop and reflect about the quality of the data being used to create your new signatures.
If the metrics provided above for the input matrices do not appear to be outperforming the randomized matrices, you may wish to set more restrictive demands on what samples can be used as input data.
It also could be helpful to examine the sample-by-component matrix as a heatmap to see if there are  major contributions from many different samples to each component.  
If a clear Factorization rank (number of signatures) emerges, continue on...
  
### IV - Create the signatures
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
signatures <- GenerateSignatures(sample_by_component,<num signatures>)
saveRDS(signatures, file = paste0("path_to_signatures/signatures_object.rds"))

# Also save the component models created earlier for re-use
saveRDS(component_models, file = paste0("path_to_signatures/component_models_object.rds"))
```
  
Create the signatures using the GenerateSignatures() function, and then save them.
Evaluate your handi-work by visualizing both the:  
-> component-by-signature matrix as a heatmap  
-> sample-by-signature matrix as a heatmap (contribution of each sample to each signature)  
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Using the aheatmap functions built into NMF package...
library(NMF)

pdf(file = '~/projects/cn-signatures-project/plots/sample-by-signature_heatmap.pdf', 7, 7, onefile = FALSE)
coefmap(signatures, Colv="consensus", tracks=c("basis:"), main="Sample x Signature matrix")
dev.off()

pdf(file = file = '~/projects/cn-signatures-project/plots/component-by-signature_heatmap.pdf', 7, 7, onefile = FALSE)
basismap(signatures, Rowv = NA, main = "Signature x Component matrix")
dev.off()
```
