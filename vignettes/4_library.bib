   abstract = {<p> The bevacizumab (bev)/olaparib (ola) maintenance regimen was approved for <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> -mutated (BRCAmut) and Homologous Recombination Deficient (HRD) high-grade Advanced Ovarian Cancer (AOC) first line setting, based on a significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to bev alone in the PAOLA-1/ENGOT-ov25 trial (NCT02477644), where HRD was detected by MyChoice CDx PLUS test. The academic <italic>shallowHRDv2</italic> test was developed based on shallow whole-genome sequencing as an alternative to MyChoice. Analytical and clinical validities of <italic>shallowHRDv2</italic> as compared to MyChoice on 449 PAOLA-1 tumor samples are presented. The overall agreement between <italic>shallowHRDv2</italic> and MyChoice was 94% (369/394). Less non-contributive tests were observed with <italic>shallowHRDv2</italic> (15/449; 3%) than with MyChoice (51/449; 11%). Patients with HRD tumors according to <italic>shallowHRDv2</italic> (including BRCAmut) showed a significantly prolonged PFS with bev+ola versus bev (median PFS: 65.7 versus 20.3 months, hazard ratio (HR): 0.36 [95% CI: 0.24–0.53]). This benefit was significant also for <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> wild-type tumors (40.8 versus 19.5 months, HR: 0.45 [95% CI: 0.26–0.76]). <italic>ShallowHRDv2</italic> is a performant, clinically validated, and cost-effective test for HRD detection. </p>},
