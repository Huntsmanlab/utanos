\title{Extract Copy Number Tally Matrix}
\usage{
GetCNTally(
  CN_data,
  genome = "hg19",
  relative = FALSE,
  extra_features = FALSE,
  subset_features = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CN_data}{A list of CN features. Typically, this should be the output from functions like \code{ExtractCopyNumberFeatures()}
or \code{ExtractRelativeCopyNumberFeatures()}.}

\item{genome}{A character string specifying the genome build (default: 'hg19').
This parameter is currently unused but can be included for compatibility with future updates.}

\item{relative}{A logical value. Set to TRUE if using relative copy number data (default: FALSE).
If TRUE, the function will use relative feature settings.}

\item{extra_features}{A logical value indicating whether to include extra CN features in the tally (default: FALSE).
When set to TRUE, additional feature settings are applied.}

\item{subset_features}{A character vector specifying feature names to include in the result.
If not NULL, only columns corresponding to these features will be returned.}
}
\value{
A matrix where rows represent components (samples) and columns represent CN features.
If \code{subset_features} is provided, only the specified features are included in the matrix.
}
\description{
Computes a tally matrix based on copy number (CN) data, either in absolute or relative terms.
The function supports the inclusion of additional CN features and allows filtering by specific feature subsets.
}
